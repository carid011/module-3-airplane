problem statement 
The goal of this assignment is to make a code that works for an airplane in C coding. 
The airline has one plane with 24 seats and operates two flights, one outbound and the other inbound.
The code needs an array to create the seat information, and give the menu availibity, seat assign, delete, and the passengers.

Describe solution 
I used C programming. I made two arrays for each flight, outbound and inbound. 
I started by making all the seats empty. I made a main menu to allow the person to choose between outbound, inbound, and quitting the program. 
After they can choose the seat, delete it, and return.

pro and cons
-Menu requirement
-It is understandable

-there is separation
-You can return and lose the information if wrong input is given; it does not give other options
