problem statement
The goal of this assingment is to make a code that works for an airplane i n C coding. The airline has one plane with 24 seats
and operates two flights one is outbound and the other is inbound. The code needs an array to 
create the seat information, and give the menu availibity, seat assign, delete and the passengers. 

Describe solution
I used to C programming I made two arrays for each flight outbound and inbound. I start by
making all the seats empty, I make a main menu to allow the person to choose between
oubound, inbound, and quitting the program. After they can can choose the seat, delete and retun back. 

pro and cons 
- Menu requirment
- it is understandable
- there is speration

-you can return and lose the information
-if wrong input it does not gave other options
